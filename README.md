# ansible-pi

I use this to deploy my Raspberrys at home. I have one as Musicbox and 433MHz remote and another as Pi Hole and Proxy

## HowTo

At first ensure everything is up to date, there is a script for this:
```
TODO
```

After this run Ansible to deploy all machines configured in [hosts:hosts]

```
ansible-playbook site.yml -k
```
